// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(a+b)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(num%2 == 0 then num is even else num is odd )

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(a. enter a, enter b, enter c, enter d, enter e)(b. (numavg = a+b+c+d+e)/5 ) (c. if num < min then min = num, if num > max then max = num)
(d. (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 16/5 = 3.2) (d2. 1 <= min(10)  then min = 1, 1 >= max(1) then max = 1// 2 <= min(1)  no change min, 2 >= max(1) then max = 2//
3 <= min(1)  no change min, 3 >= max(2) then max = 3// 4 <= min(1)  no change min, 1 >= max(1) then max = 1 //5 <= min(1) no change min, 5 >= max(1) then max = 5)
